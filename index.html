    It belongs to the order of beryls, in most found samples it is a blue or blue-green mineral, in the Mohs hardness table beryls are around 7.5-8. Aquamarine has the ability to disperse light, so when the optical axis changes, it changes from blue to an almost colorless shade.
    it consists mostly of oxygen and silicon, with a smaller part of aluminum and beryllium.

    Goshenite is a colorless gem variety of beryl. It is called the mother of all gemstones because it can be transformed into other like emerald, morganite, or bixbite. Goshenite is also referred to as the purest form of beryl since there are generally no other elements present in the stone.  The gem is used as imitation for diamond or emerald by adding colored foil on it.
